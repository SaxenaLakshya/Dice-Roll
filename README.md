# Dice Game

A simple and fun web-based Dice Game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game generates random outcomes for two dice whenever the page is refreshed, and the winner is determined based on the higher dice roll.

## Features
- Two dice with randomized outcomes on every page refresh.
- Displays the winner based on the higher dice roll or declares a draw if both rolls are equal.
- Interactive and minimalistic design for a seamless experience.

## How It Works
1. Two dice are displayed on the screen.
2. When the page is refreshed, each die shows a random number (from 1 to 6).
3. The game compares the outcomes of both dice and declares:
   - **Player 1 Wins** if the first die has a higher number.
   - **Player 2 Wins** if the second die has a higher number.
   - **It's a Draw** if both dice show the same number.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: For generating random outcomes and determining the winner.

## Future Improvements
- Add a "Roll Dice" button instead of refreshing the page.
- Animate the dice rolling for better user experience.
- Display a scoreboard to track wins for each player.
